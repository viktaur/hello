# Welcome to Hello repository
### What's hello?
Hello repository is a place where you can write everything you want.

### How can I edit?
"Hello" is hosted on GitHub, a website where you can write your own code like I'm doing right now. Also, and the most important function, you can write code with other people at the same time.

# Important items
### How can I insert code on a readme file?
Do you want to write this?

```<html>Hello World!</html>```

No problem, it's so easy. You just have to put '```' (without quotes) at the beginning and end.

```
<p>And you will be able to write something like this.</p>
<p>So other people can copy and paste coden at readme files.</p>
```

# About branches and compatibility with other programming apps
For the moment we know very little about branches. We are also working with other programs like Atom that have GitHub complete integration. It's not easy to do that, but we are learning a lot, don't you?

Now I've learned a lot about GitHub. Thank you. New changes from Visual Studio.
