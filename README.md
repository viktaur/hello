# Welcome to Hello repository
### What's hello?
Hello repository is a place where you can write everything you want.

### How can I edit?
"Hello" is hosted on GitHub, a website where you can write your own code like I'm doing right now. Also, and the most important function, you can write code with other people at the same time. 

# Important items
### How can I insert code on a readme file?
Do you want to write this?

```<html>Hello World!</html>```

No problem, it's so easy. You just have to put '```' (without quotes) at the beginning and end.
